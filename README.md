# Swagger generated server

Spring Boot Server for BPDTS Test


## Overview  
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  

Development was done using IntelliJ

I've included prebuilt JAR package in the target folder, swagger-spring-1.0.0.jar

JAR can be compile and packaged using Maven and the pom.xml supplied

Start your server as an simple java application, example: java -jar swagger-spring-1.0.0.jar

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to  
http://localhost:8080/  

YAML API definition is in swagger_def folder.

I have a test version hosted on a Raspberry PI.  The following link
should work, it's my router's IP; if the router reboots its address will change.
